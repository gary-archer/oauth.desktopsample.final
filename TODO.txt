1. Get an API mechanism basically working that just throws a loginRequired error back
   Disable strict mode initially
   This will simplify FetchClient
   If will also get FetchService in better shape
   Perhaps add ApiInput and ApiOutput data structures between renderer and main.
   This will include session ID and transaction ID.
   It could involve a switch on operation name in order to get the base URL for user info.

2. Remove configuration from renderer
   Simplify the React code
   _sendRequestResponseIpcMessages should return JSON.parse
   
3. Main side will be hit by concurrency.
   Metadata lookup happens on a new login, a token refresh, or a logout request.
   Drive this from my client side concurrency logic.
   Server side initialize method needed due to client side strict mode???
   I may need to call server side initialize, to prevent concurrent API requests all calling getMetadata
   Get strict mode working

4. Deep links to get working and final code tidy ups
   Look at each file and think more about naming
   Use UIEvents to distinguish it from IpcEvents
