1. Get OAuth calls working to enable wider testing
   ClearLoginState / ExpireAccessToken / ExpireRefreshToken
   Then Refresh
   Test and reduce OAuth code

2. Tidy up and reduce other code
   Can I do more in AppViewModel constructor?
   Rename classes to UIEvents and IpcEvents
   Drive session ID from the client side and send it in options
   Initialize code in app and view model
   Trim down the React code

3. Deep links to get working and final code tidy ups
   Look at each file and think more about naming
   Use UIEvents to distinguish it from IpcEvents
   Private scheme name to be passed through to renderer if needed
   ON_PRIVATE_URI_SCHEME_NOTIFICATION -> ON_DEEP_LINK

4. Enable strict mode
   Think more about main side and concurrency, eg multiple clicks.
   Metadata lookup happens on a new login, a token refresh, or a logout request.
   Drive this from my client side concurrency logic.
   Server side initialize method needed due to client side strict mode???
   I may need to call server side initialize, to prevent concurrent API requests all calling getMetadata
   Get strict mode working

5. Blog updates
   Mention use of a proxy for debugging - as for any other desktop app
   Test against local API
   Test on Windows and macOS
   Test using HTTP Proxy and update config if needed
