   Metadata lookup happens on a new login, a token refresh, or a logout request
   Put back strict mode
   Test and reduce OAuth code
   getUserInfoEndpoint may not need to be async, cf old code

3. Tidy up and reduce other code
   Can I do more in AppViewModel constructor?
   Rename classes to UIEvents and IpcEvents
   Drive session ID from the client side and send it in options
   Initialize code in app and view model
   Trim down the React code

4. Deep links to get working and final code tidy ups
   Look at each file and think more about naming
   Use UIEvents to distinguish it from IpcEvents
   Private scheme name to be passed through to renderer if needed
   ON_PRIVATE_URI_SCHEME_NOTIFICATION -> ON_DEEP_LINK

5. Blog updates
   Mention use of a proxy for debugging - as for any other desktop app
   Test against local API
   Test on Windows and macOS
