1. Get OAuth calls working to enable wider testing

2. Tidy up code
   Drive session ID from the client side and send it in options
   Remove configuration from renderer side
   Trim down the React code
  
3. Enable strict mode
   Think more about main side and concurrency, eg multiple clicks.
   Metadata lookup happens on a new login, a token refresh, or a logout request.
   Drive this from my client side concurrency logic.
   Server side initialize method needed due to client side strict mode???
   I may need to call server side initialize, to prevent concurrent API requests all calling getMetadata
   Get strict mode working

4. Deep links to get working and final code tidy ups
   Look at each file and think more about naming
   Use UIEvents to distinguish it from IpcEvents
