1. Add FetchClient and FetchService implementations and interfaces
   Useful for reasoning
   
2. Some kind of ApiInput and ApiOutput data structures between renderer and main.
   Will include session ID and transaction ID.

3. Main side will be hit by concurrency.
   Metadata lookup happens on a new login, a token refresh, or a logout request.
   Drive this from my client side concurrency logic.
   Server side initialize method needed due to client side strict mode???
